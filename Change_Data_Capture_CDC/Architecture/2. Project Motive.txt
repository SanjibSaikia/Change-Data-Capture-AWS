The Aim of this POC is to Auto Update the dataset in S3 when any changes are made in MySQL table dataset in local machine.

Brief Intro :
Data is uploaded from MySQL database to AWS RDS(Relational Database Service) and pushed into AWS S3(Simple Storage Service) bucket.
Any changes in the data in MySQL(local) will auto reflect in RDS and will result in auto update of dataset in S3 bucket which we uploaded earlier.
